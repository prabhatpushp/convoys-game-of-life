# Convoys Game of Life 🌌

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Convoys Game of Life**! 🎮 This interactive simulation is inspired by Conway's Game of Life, where you can explore cellular automata and witness how simple rules can lead to complex behaviors. The game allows you to create, manipulate, and observe the evolution of a grid of cells, making it a fascinating tool for both learning and experimentation.

## Features 🌟
- **Interactive Grid**: Click to toggle the state of cells between alive and dead.
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Watch as the grid evolves based on the rules of life and death.
- **Panning and Zooming**: Easily navigate the grid with mouse controls for a better view of your creations.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust parameters like cell size and grid density to suit your preferences.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
This project is built with:
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web application.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic and interactivity.
- **Canvas API**: For rendering the grid and visual elements.

## Getting Started 🚀
To get started with the Convoys Game of Life, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
   cd convoys-game-of-life
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**:
   Simply open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.

## How to Play 🎹
- **Toggle Cells**: Click on the grid to toggle the state of individual cells.
- **Observe Evolution**: Watch how the cells evolve over time based on the rules of the game.
- **Panning**: Click and drag to pan around the grid.
- **Zooming**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the grid.

## Future Ideas 💡
- **Save and Load Configurations**: Allow users to save their grid configurations and load them later.
- **Custom Rules**: Enable users to define their own rules for cell evolution.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Optimize the game for mobile devices for on-the-go play.
